<a name="10"></a>Information Concerning TD's Settlement with OFAC</h5><p>On January 13, 2017, The Toronto-Dominion Bank ("TD") reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC") regarding alleged violations that occurred between 2003 and 2011 of certain U.S. sanctions programs relating to Iran and Cuba. The settlement resolves OFAC&rsquo;s investigation into apparent violations stemming from transactions which occurred within TD's Trade Finance, Commercial and Retail Banking businesses in Canada, and within its European Wealth businesses (wholly owned subsidiaries Internaxx Bank SA and TD Waterhouse Investment Services (Europe) Limited). These matters exclusively involved TD Operations outside of the United States and did not involve any of TD's businesses other than those referenced above and in the settlement agreement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>TD voluntarily self-disclosed the historic transactions, undertaken by TD customers, after they were identified as part of a proactive internal compliance review. At all times TD cooperated fully with OFAC in their investigation. The activity was specifically not considered egregious and OFAC publicly acknowledged that TD took a &ldquo;robust remedial response.&rdquo; The total settlement agreement amount of <strong>US$516,105</strong> fully resolves OFAC&rsquo;s concerns.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>TD takes compliance very seriously and has a robust global sanctions compliance program, including policies, procedures and controls aimed at mitigating risk and detecting such issues. Shortly before identifying these issues, TD took steps to enhance its sanctions compliance function in all jurisdictions where it operates.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Detailed information concerning TD's settlement with OFAC can be found here:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20170113_33.aspx" target="_blank">&gt; TD's Settlement with OFAC</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><span class="rightAligned"><a href="#Back_Top" class="backToTop">Back to Top</a></span>
